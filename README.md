# Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

I have designed and built an ATM machine using a bottom-up implementation in VHDL language.

The implementation is compatible with Digilent Basys 3 boards and the device can be tested by uploading the VHDL  
code to the board using the software provided by Xilinx (_Vivado_).
