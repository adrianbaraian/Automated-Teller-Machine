PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net C0/CARD/O_reg[0]_C_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin C0/CARD/O_reg[18]_LDC_i_1/O, cell C0/CARD/O_reg[18]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net C0/CARD/O_reg[0]_C_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin C0/CARD/O_reg[18]_LDC_i_1__0/O, cell C0/CARD/O_reg[18]_LDC_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net C0/CARD/O_reg[0]_C_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin C0/CARD/O_reg[18]_LDC_i_1__1/O, cell C0/CARD/O_reg[18]_LDC_i_1__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning

Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net C1/FSM_sequential_curr_state_reg[1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin C1/O_reg[18]_LDC_i_1__3/O, cell C1/O_reg[18]_LDC_i_1__3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
